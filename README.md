Yummy
---
**This project is going to be a clone of sanpp food with Python and Django framework.**

---

## What is yummy?

It’s actually a service which users can order food very easily and restaurant managers can register their services so
that other people can use them.

As I said this is going to be a clone of this service , clearly It’s not going to implement all the features

---

## The goal of this project:

The main purpose of this project is being an acceptable resume and also a good practice of Django framework

---

## Features:

- [x] We will have two type of users in this project : 1 - Customer 2 - Service Provider.
- [x] Each service provider can provide different services such as (restaurant, fast food, confectionery, supermarket,
  …).

- [x] Each service will have active days and hours.
- [x] Each customer can have different addresses.
- [x] Each customer will be able to see the services(only the supported services in their area).
- [x] Each customer can add items to their cart(note : Each cart can only contain items from one specific service, that
  means adding items from different services causes multiple carts).
- [ ] Each customer will be able to add comment for the items which was in their cart after the order was delivered(
  note: customers will be able to add one comment for an item after each successful order).
- [ ] Each item will have a score based on its comments.
